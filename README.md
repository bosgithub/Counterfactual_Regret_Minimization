# Counterfactual_Regret_Minimization

#### What is Counterfactual Regret Minimization(CFR)?

CFR is a self play algorithm, it learns to play a game by playing against itself over and over. 

Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is used to solve large imperfect information games. 

It converges to an equilibrium by iteratively traversing the game tree.
